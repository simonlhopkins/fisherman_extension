            <div class = "heading">
                <p> The Lonely Fisherman is part browser game, part Chrome extension. In the game, you fish with the lonely fisherman while he rambles about his life. However, if you leave the fisherman and go to other tabs, he gets upset and tries to get you to come back by interfering with your web browsing experience. </p>

            <h2 class = "resumeHeading"> How to Install </h2>

            <div class = "heading">
                <p> Currently, you must manually install the extension, but we are looking at publishing on the Google Chrome store to simplify the process. </p>
                <p> Note: This game <i>will</i> make your web browsing experience much worse. Please do not install or enable this extension if you need an uninterrupted web browsing experience. </p>
            </div>

            <div class = "links">
                <a href = "extension.zip"> Download unpacked extension </a>
            </div>


            <div class = "heading">
                <p> First things first, you're going to need either Chrome or Firefox installed. We tried it once on Firefox early in development so there's no guarantee that it works but according to Firefox documentation it should be pretty cross compatible. </p>
                <br/>
                <p> Assuming you've installed or already have Chrome: </p>
                <p> 1. Type "chrome://extensions" into your search bar (without the quotes). </p>
                <p> 2. Turn on Developer Mode with the switch on the top right of your screen. </p>
                <p> 3. Click "Load Unpacked" and then select the folder called extension. </p>
                <p> 4. Find the "The Lonely Fisherman" extension in the list of extensions and turn it on with the toggle switch (note that's also how you'll have to disable it if you want to free yourself). </p>
                <p> 5. Then launch the game at http://www.thelonelyfisherman.com and you're all set to play! </p>

                <p> How to stop him: </p>
                <p> The only ways to stop him are to turn off the extension (using the same toggle that you had to turn on during step 4) or to remove the extension by clicking remove (nearby that same toggle). </p>
                <p> If the extension isn't installed you can still play the fishing game but you'll find that the fisherman doesn't disrupt your internet browsing experience. </p>
